    "comment": "Why I’m Voting ‘No’ on Reducing the Cardano Treasury Tax\n\n1. A Check on Overspending\nThe treasury tax was set at 20% from Cardano’s early days to fuel growth and innovation. It’s a high bar by design. Recent discussions, like the Intersect budget proposal, have sparked fair concerns about spending creeping beyond what’s sustainable. Cutting the tax might seem like a quick fix to limit funds and force discipline, but I see it differently. Keeping it at 20% gives us room to prioritise high-impact projects while maintaining oversight. Lowering it now risks underfunding the very initiatives that keep Cardano competitive.  \n\n2. Our Network’s Safety Net\nThink of the treasury as Cardano’s insurance policy. Staking rewards drive our ecosystem today, but they’re not guaranteed to cover all future costs, whether that’s development, security upgrades, or market downturns. A robust treasury, built from the 20% tax, ensures we’re not caught short when needs arise. Reducing it to 10% shrinks that buffer at a time when we can’t predict tomorrow’s challenges. I’d rather hold steady now than scramble later.  \n\n3. Managing ADA’s Circulation\nFrom a practical angle: the treasury tax pulls a chunk of ADA out of circulation, acting as a natural brake on supply. Dropping it to 10% would release more coins into the market, potentially a lot more. With whispers of a strong market cycle ahead, this could flood circulation, pressuring ADA’s value when stability could be our strength. Timing is critical, and this move feels like a risk we don’t need to take yet.  \n\n4. Open to Future Review\nI’m not against adjusting the tax forever. If we see clear evidence of efficient treasury spending over time, say, after a year of consistent budget reviews, I’d be open to revisiting this. For now, the case for caution outweighs the push for change. The treasury’s role as a stabilizer, both financially and economically, is too vital to weaken today.  \n\nThis vote reflects my best judgment as your DRep, but it’s your delegation that drives me. I’d welcome your input, agree or disagree, let’s talk. Cardano thrives when we shape it together. Find me on X or LinkedIN to weigh in.  \n\nPeter Horsfall, Cardano DRep\nFebruary 19, 2025"
